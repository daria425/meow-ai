                    2. **Cuteness Factor**: Does the cartoonized image capture the essence of cuteness? Are the features exaggerated in a way that enhances the cuteness?
                    3. **Artistic Style**: Does the cartoonized image maintain a consistent and appealing cartoon style? Are the colors vibrant and the lines clean?
                    4. **Overall Impression**: What is your overall impression of the cartoonized image? Does it evoke a positive emotional response?
